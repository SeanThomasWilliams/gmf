Just make one output byte stream.
It should write the packet bytes to one place
FFMPEG should take care of the PAT/PMT stuff, hopefully before the keyframe. Otherwise it should still be contiguous
video.
Just keep writing out the packet bytes to the write callback, then to cassandra. Don't close the "file" anymore since
its in memory.
